<a name="top"></a><h1>Week commencing 16/10/2023</h1><p class="book_summary"><p>This week we summed up your notes on both short stories and looked at how the essay could be put together.</p>
<p>This is the <a href="data/Lesson%206%20Short%20Fiction.pptx"><strong>PowerPoint for today's session</strong>.</a></p>
<p>We considered how to use literary criticism in your essay - it is not essential but can be helpful.</p>
<p>Literary criticism of <strong><a href="data/Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle%20Literary%20Criticism.docx">The Case of Lady Sannox.</a></strong></p>
<p>Literary criticism of <a href="data/D.H.%20Lawrence%20criticism.doc"><strong>Fanny and Annie</strong>.</a></p>
<p>We looked at sample essays from the past and discussed them - unfortunately, these cannot be added to the VLE.</p>
<p>This is an <strong><a href="data/Short%20Fiction%20Essay%20Plan.doc">essay plan</a></strong> - you do not have to use it if you do not wish to.</p>
<p>Next week you should bring in laptops and your work to date - it is a workshop for completing the assignment.  I can look at your work and give you advice.</p>
