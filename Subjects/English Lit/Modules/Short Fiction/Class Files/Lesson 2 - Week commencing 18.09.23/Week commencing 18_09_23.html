main character, including some secondary characters, to whom a life changing,
poignant and often ironic event or perception occurs as an intensely observed
moment of time.</div>

<div>•<u>Novels</u> have
a layering effect – characters are brought in, we learn more about them.&nbsp;</div>

<div>•This might have been interesting if Conan
Doyle had extended The Case of Lady Sannox to a
novel form BUT you would lose the IMPACT and IMMEDIACY.&nbsp;</div>

<div>•A SHORT STORY SHOULD LEAVE YOU THINKING
ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS!</div><div><br></div><div>We considered why the content of this story is particularly suited to the short story form.</div><div><br></div><div>Next, we looked at the difference between PLOT and NARRATIVE PERSPECTIVE.&nbsp; This is the famous quote from E.M. Forster:</div><div><br></div><div><strong>E.M. Forster’s Famous Definition of Plot<br></strong></div><strong><br></strong><div><strong>•He observed that if we write, “The king
died, and the queen died,” we have a narrative but if we write, instead, “The
king died, and the queen died of grief,” then we have a plot.&nbsp; </strong></div>

<div><strong>•The second assertion has established a
link of cause between the two events.&nbsp; This, the making of connections, or
designs, is the essence of storytelling.&nbsp; </strong></div>

<div><strong>•Narrative is simply a record of what
happened.&nbsp; For narrative to become a plot must reveal its meaning in human
terms.&nbsp; Events only become interesting, which is to say relevant to our
understanding of life, when we see their effect upon people, or, in the case of
fiction, upon characters.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></div><br><span>We looked at the <strong><a href="data/Narrative%20viewpoint.doc">handout on narrative perspectives</a></strong> and then worked through the </span><strong><a href="data/Identifying%20narrative%20perspectives.docx">narrative perspectives exercise</a>.<br></strong><br>Giving detailed responses in your work is easier if you use PEE structure (Point-Evidence-Evaluation).&nbsp; Have a look at <strong><a href="data/PEE%20Exercise.docx">this worksheet</a></strong> and try it yourself.&nbsp; This is <strong><a href="data/PEE_Example.pptx">an example of a PEE response.</a></strong><br>&nbsp;<br>We went on to discuss <strong><a href="data/Plot%20Structure%20PowerPoint.ppt">the STRUCTURE of the short story</a></strong>.<br><br>Reading the short story, <em><strong><a href="data/3littlepigs.doc">The Three Little Pigs,</a></strong></em>&nbsp;you identified each element of structure within it.&nbsp;<br><br>You then identified the TURNING POINT in <em>The Three Little Pigs.&nbsp; </em>We went on to identify the turning point in <em>The Case of Lady Sannox.<br></em><br><span>Homework is to:<br></span><br><div>•Create a PEE paragraph in which you
identify the turning point in the short story and your justification for this
decision.</div>

<div>•Remember to PEE!</div>

<div>•Word process and bring to class next
Friday.</div><br><p></p></div><a href="#toc">&uarr; top</a>
