<DIV class=3Dtitle_text>The Case of Lady Sannox</DIV>
<DIV class=3Dstory_text>
<P>The relations between Douglas Stone and the notorious Lady Sannox =
were very=20
well known both among the fashionable circles of which she was a =
brilliant=20
member, and the scientific bodies which numbered him among their most=20
illustrious confreres. There was naturally, therefore, a very widespread =

interest when it was announced one morning that the lady had absolutely =
and for=20
ever taken the veil, and that the world would see her no more. When, at =
the very=20
tail of this rumour, there came the assurance that the celebrated =
operating=20
surgeon, the man of steel nerves, had been found in the morning by his =
valet,=20
seated on one side of his bed, smiling pleasantly upon the universe, =
with both=20
legs jammed into one side of his breeches and his great brain about as =
valuable=20
as a cap full of porridge, the matter was strong enough to give quite a =
little=20
thrill of interest to folk who had never hoped that their jaded nerves =
were=20
capable of such a sensation. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Douglas Stone in his prime was one of the =
most=20
remarkable men in England. Indeed, he could hardly be said to have ever =
reached=20
his prime, for he was but nine-and-thirty at the time of this little =
incident.=20
Those who knew him best were aware that famous as he was as a surgeon, =
he might=20
have succeeded with even greater rapidity in any of a dozen lines of =
life. He=20
could have cut his way to fame as a soldier, struggled to it as an =
explorer,=20
bullied for it in the courts, or built it out of stone and iron as an =
engineer.=20
He was born to be great, for he could plan what another man dare not do, =
and he=20
could do what another man dare not plan. In surgery none could follow =
him. His=20
nerve, his judgement, his intuition, were things apart. Again and again =
his=20
knife cut away death, but grazed the very springs of life in doing it, =
until his=20
assistants were as white as the patient. His energy, his audacity, his=20
full-blooded self-confidence - does not the memory of them still linger =
to the=20
south of Marylebone Road and the north of Oxford Street? </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His vices were as magnificent as his =
virtues, and=20
infinitely more picturesque. Large as was his income, and it was the =
third=20
largest of all professional men in London, it was far beneath the luxury =
of his=20
living. Deep in his complex nature lay a rich vein of sensualism, at the =
sport=20
of which he placed all the prizes of his life. The eye, the ear, the =
touch, the=20
palate, all were his masters. The bouquet of old vintages, the scent of =
rare=20
exotics, the curves and tints of the daintiest potteries of Europe, it =
was to=20
these that the quick-running stream of gold was transformed. And then =
there came=20
his sudden mad passion for Lady Sannox, when a single interview with two =

challenging glances and a whispered word set him ablaze. She was the =
loveliest=20
woman in London and the only one to him. He was one of the handsomest =
men in=20
London, but not the only one to her. She had a liking for new =
experiences, and=20
was gracious to most men who wooed her. It may have been cause or it may =
have=20
been effect that Lord Sannox looked fifty, though he was but =
six-and-thirty.=20
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was a quiet, silent, neutral-tinted man, =
this=20
lord, with thin lips and heavy eyelids, much given to gardening, and =
full of=20
home-like habits. He had at one time been fond of acting, had even =
rented a=20
theatre in London, and on its boards had first seen Miss Marion Dawson, =
to whom=20
he had offered his hand, his title, and the third of a county. Since his =

marriage his early hobby had become distasteful to him. Even in private=20
theatricals it was no longer possible to persuade him to exercise the =
talent=20
which he had often showed that he possessed. He was happier with a spud =
and a=20
watering-can among his orchids and chrysanthemums. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was quite an interesting problem whether =
he was=20
absolutely devoid of sense, or miserably wanting in spirit. Did he know =
his=20
lady's ways and condone them, or was he a mere blind, doting fool? It =
was a=20
point to be discussed over the teacups in snug little drawing-rooms, or =
with the=20
aid of a cigar in the bow windows of clubs. Bitter and plain were the =
comments=20
among men upon his conduct. There was but one who had a good word to say =
for=20
him, and he was the most silent member in the smoking-room. He had seen =
him=20
break in a horse at the University, and it seemed to have left an =
impression=20
upon his mind. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when Douglas Stone became the favourite =
all=20
doubts as to Lord Sannox's knowledge or ignorance were set for ever at =
rest.=20
There was no subterfuge about Stone. In his high-handed, impetuous =
fashion, he=20
set all caution and discretion at defiance. The scandal became =
notorious. A=20
learned body intimated that his name had been struck from the list of =
its=20
vice-presidents. Two friends implored him to consider his professional =
credit.=20
He cursed them all three, and spent forty guineas on a bangle to take =
with him=20
to the lady. He was at her house every evening, and she drove in his =
carriage in=20
the afternoons. There was not an attempt on either side to conceal their =

relations; but there came at last a little incident to interrupt them. =
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a dismal winter's night, very cold =
and gusty,=20
with the wind whooping in the chimneys and blustering against the =
window-panes.=20
A thin spatter of rain tinkled on the glass with each fresh sough of the =
gale,=20
drowning for the instant the dull gurgle and drip from the eaves. =
Douglas Stone=20
had finished his dinner, and sat by his fire in the study, a glass of =
rich port=20
upon the malachite table at his elbow. As he raised it to his lips, he =
held it=20
up against the lamplight, and watched with the eye of a connoisseur the =
tiny=20
scales of beeswing which floated in its rich ruby depths. The fire, as =
it=20
spurted up, threw fitful lights upon his bald, clear-cut face, with its=20
widely-opened grey eyes, its thick and yet firm lips, and the deep, =
square jaw,=20
which had something Roman in its strength and its animalism. He smiled =
from time=20
to time as he nestled back in his luxurious chair. Indeed, he had a =
right to=20
feel well pleased, for, against the advice of six colleagues, he had =
performed=20
an operation that day of which only two cases were on record, and the =
result had=20
been brilliant beyond all expectation. No other man in London would have =
had the=20
daring to plan, or the skill to execute, such a heroic measure. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he had promised Lady Sannox to see her =
that=20
evening and it was already half-past eight. His hand was outstretched to =
the=20
bell to order the carriage when he heard the dull thud of the knocker. =
An=20
instant later there was the shuffling of feet in the hall, and the sharp =
closing=20
of a door. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A patient to see you, sir, in the =
consulting room,"=20
said the butler. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "About himself?" </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, sir; I think he wants you to go out." =
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is too late," cried Douglas Stone =
peevishly. "I=20
won't go." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is his card, sir." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The butler presented it upon the gold salver =
which=20
had been given to his master by the wife of a Prime Minister. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "'Hamil Ali, Smyrna.' Hum! The fellow is a =
Turk, I=20
suppose." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, sir. He seems as if he came from =
abroad, sir.=20
And he's in a terrible way." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tut, tut! I have an engagement. I must go =
somewhere=20
else. But I'll see him. Show him in here, Pim." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few moments later the butler swung open =
the door=20
and ushered in a small and decrepit man, who walked with a bent back and =
with=20
the forward push of the face and blink of the eyes which goes with =
extreme short=20
sight. His face was swarthy, and his hair and beard of the deepest =
black. In one=20
hand he held a turban of white muslin striped with red, in the other a =
small=20
chamois-leather bag. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good evening," said Douglas Stone, when the =
butler=20
had closed the door. "You speak English, I presume?" </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, sir. I am from Asia Minor, but I speak =
English=20
when I speak slow." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You wanted me to go out, I understand?" =
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, sir. I wanted very much that you =
should see my=20
wife." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I could come in the morning, but I have an=20
engagement which prevents me from seeing your wife tonight." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Turk's answer was a singular one. He =
pulled the=20
string which closed the mouth of the chamois-leather bag, and poured a =
flood of=20
gold on to the table. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are one hundred pounds there," said =
he, "and=20
I promise you that it will not take you an hour. I have a cab ready at =
the=20
door." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Douglas Stone glanced at his watch. An hour =
would=20
not make it too late to visit Lady Sannox. He had been there later. And =
the fee=20
was an extraordinarily high one. He had been pressed by his creditors =
lately,=20
and he could not afford to let such a chance pass. He would go. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the case?" he asked. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, it is so sad a one! So sad a one! You =
have not,=20
perhaps heard of the daggers of the Almohades?" </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Never." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, they are Eastern daggers of a great age =
and of=20
a singular shape, with the hilt like what you call a stirrup. I am a =
curiosity=20
dealer, you understand, and that is why I have come to England from =
Smyrna, but=20
next week I go back once more. Many things I brought with me, and I have =
a few=20
things left, but among them, to my sorrow, is one of these daggers." =
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will remember that I have an =
appointment, sir,"=20
said the surgeon, with some irritation; "pray confine yourself to the =
necessary=20
details." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will see that it is necessary. Today my =
wife=20
fell down in a faint in the room in which I keep my wares, and she cut =
her lower=20
lip upon this cursed dagger of Almohades." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I see," said Douglas Stone, rising. "And =
you wish=20
me to dress the wound?" </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, it is worse than that." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What then?" </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These daggers are poisoned." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Poisoned!" </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, and there is no man, East or West, who =
can=20
tell now what is the poison or what the cure. But all that is known I =
know, for=20
my father was in this trade before me, and we have had much to do with =
these=20
poisoned weapons." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are the symptoms?" </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Deep sleep, and death in thirty hours." =
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And you say there is no cure. Why then =
should you=20
pay me this considerable fee?" </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No drug can cure, but the knife may." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And how?" </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The poison is slow of absorption. It =
remains for=20
hours in the wound." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Washing, then, might cleanse it?" </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No more than in a snake bite. It is too =
subtle and=20
too deadly." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Excision of the wound, then?" </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is it. If it be on the finger, take =
the finger=20
off. So said my father always. But think of where this wound is, and =
that it is=20
my wife. It is dreadful!" </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But familiarity with such grim matters may =
take the=20
finer edge from a man's sympathy. To Douglas Stone this was already an=20
interesting case, and he brushed aside as irrelevant the feeble =
objections of=20
the husband. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It appears to be that or nothing," said he=20
brusquely. "It is better to loose a lip than a life." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, yes, I know that you are right. Well, =
well, it=20
is kismet, and it must be faced. I have the cab, and you will come with =
me and=20
do this thing." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Douglas Stone took his case of bistouries =
from a=20
drawer, and placed it with a roll of bandage and a compress of lint in =
his=20
pocket. He must waste no more time if he were to see Lady Sannox. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am ready," said he, pulling on his =
overcoat.=20
"Will you take a glass of wine before you go out into this cold air?" =
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His visitor shrank away, with a protesting =
hand=20
upraised. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You forget that I am a Mussulman, and a =
true=20
follower of the Prophet," said he. "But tell me what is the bottle of =
green=20
glass which you have placed in your pocket?" </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is chloroform." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, that also is forbidden to us. It is a =
spirit,=20
and we make no use of such things." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What! You would allow your wife to go =
through an=20
operation without an anaesthetic?" </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah! she will feel nothing, poor soul. The =
deep=20
sleep has already come on, which is the first working of the poison. And =
then I=20
have given her of our Smyrna opium. Come, sir, for already an hour has =
passed."=20
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As they stepped out into the darkness, a =
sheet of=20
rain was driven in upon their faces, and the hall lamp, which dangled =
from the=20
arm of a marble Caryatid, went out with a fluff. Pim, the butler, pushed =
the=20
heavy door to, straining hard with his shoulder against the wind, while =
the two=20
men groped their way towards the yellow glare which showed where the cab =
was=20
waiting. An instant later they were rattling upon their journey. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it far?" asked Douglas Stone. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, no. We have a very little quiet place =
off the=20
Euston Road." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The surgeon pressed the spring of his =
repeater and=20
listened to the little tings which told him the hour. It was a quarter =
past=20
nine. He calculated the distances, and the short time which it would =
take him to=20
perform so trivial an operation. He ought to reach Lady Sannox by ten =
o'clock.=20
Through the fogged windows he saw the blurred gas lamps dancing past, =
with=20
occasionally the broader glare of a shop front. The rain was pelting and =

rattling upon the leathern top of the carriage, and the wheels swashed =
as they=20
rolled through puddle and mud. Opposite to him the white headgear of his =

companion gleamed faintly through the obscurity. The surgeon felt in his =
pockets=20
and arranged his needles, his ligatures and his safety-pins, that no =
time might=20
be wasted when they arrived. He chafed with impatience and drummed his =
foot upon=20
the floor. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the cab slowed down at last and pulled =
up. In an=20
instant Douglas Stone was out, and the Smyrna merchant's toe was at his =
very=20
heel. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can wait," said he to the driver. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a mean-looking house in a narrow and =
sordid=20
street. The surgeon, who knew his London well, cast a swift glance into =
the=20
shadows, but there was nothing distinctive - no shop, no movement, =
nothing but a=20
double line of dull, flat-faced houses, a double stretch of wet =
flagstones which=20
gleamed in the lamplight, and a double rush of water in the gutters =
which=20
swirled and gurgled towards the sewer gratings. The door which faced =
them was=20
blotched and discoloured, and a faint light in the fan pane above, it =
served to=20
show the dust and the grime which covered it. Above in one of the =
bedroom=20
windows, there was a dull yellow glimmer. The merchant knocked loudly, =
and, as=20
he turned his dark face towards the light, Douglas Stone could see that =
it was=20
contracted with anxiety. A bolt was drawn, and an elderly woman with a =
taper=20
stood in the doorway, shielding the thin flame with her gnarled hand. =
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is all well?" gasped the merchant. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She is as you left her, sir." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She has not spoken?" </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, she is in a deep sleep." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The merchant closed the door, and Douglas =
Stone=20
walked down the narrow passage, glancing about him in some surprise as =
he did=20
so. There was no oil-cloth, no mat, no hat-rack. Deep grey dust and =
heavy=20
festoons of cobwebs met his eyes everywhere. Following the old woman up =
the=20
winding stair, his firm footfall echoed harshly through the silent =
house. There=20
was no carpet. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bedroom was on the second landing. =
Douglas Stone=20
followed the old nurse into it, with the merchant at his heels. Here, at =
least,=20
there was furniture and to spare. The floor was littered and the corners =
piled=20
with Turkish cabinets, inlaid tables, coats of chain mail, strange =
pipes, and=20
grotesque weapons. A single small lamp stood upon a bracket on the wall. =
Douglas=20
Stone took it down, and picking his way among the lumber, walked over to =
a couch=20
in the corner, on which lay a woman dressed in the Turkish fashion, with =
yashmak=20
and veil. The lower part of the face was exposed, and the surgeon saw a =
jagged=20
cut which zigzagged along the border of the under lip. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will forgive the yashmak," said the =
Turk. "You=20
know our views about women in the East." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the surgeon was not thinking about the =
yashmak.=20
This was no longer a woman to him. It was a case. He stooped and =
examined the=20
wound carefully. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are no signs of irritation," said he. =
"We=20
might delay the operation until local symptoms develop." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The husband wrung his hands in =
uncontrollable=20
agitation. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh! sir, sir," he cried. "Do not trifle. =
You do not=20
know. It is deadly. I know, and I give you my assurance that an =
operation is=20
absolutely necessary. Only the knife can save her." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And yet I am inclined to wait," said =
Douglas Stone.=20
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is enough," the Turk cried, angrily. =
"Every=20
minute is of importance, and I cannot stand here and see my wife allowed =
to=20
sink. It only remains for me to give you my thanks for having come, and =
to call=20
in some other surgeon before it is too late." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Douglas Stone hesitated. To refund that =
hundred=20
pounds was no pleasant matter. But of course if he left the case he must =
return=20
the money. And if the Turk were right and the woman died, his position =
before a=20
coroner might be an embarrassing one. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have had personal experience of this =
poison?"=20
he asked. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And you assure me that an operation is =
needful."=20
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I swear it by all that I hold sacred." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The disfigurement will be frightful." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can understand that the mouth will not be =
a=20
pretty one to kiss." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Douglas Stone turned fiercely upon the man. =
The=20
speech was a brutal one. But the Turk has his own fashion of talk and of =

thought, and there was no time for wrangling. Douglas Stone drew a =
bistoury from=20
his case, opened it and felt the keen straight edge with his forefinger. =
Then he=20
held the lamp closer to the bed. Two dark eyes were gazing up at him =
through the=20
slit in the yashmak. They were all iris, and the pupil was hardly to be =
seen.=20
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have given her a very heavy dose of =
opium."=20
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, she has had a good dose." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He glanced again at the dark eyes which =
looked=20
straight at his own. They were dull and lustreless, but, even as he =
gazed, a=20
little shifting sparkle came into them, and the lips quivered. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She is not absolutely unconscious," said =
he. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would it not be well to use the knife while =
it will=20
be painless?" </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same thought had crossed the surgeon's =
mind. He=20
grasped the wounded lip with his forceps, and with two swift cuts he =
took out a=20
broad V-shaped piece. The woman sprang up on the couch with a dreadful =
gurgling=20
scream. Her covering was torn from her face. It was a face that he knew. =
In=20
spite of that protruding upper lip and that slobber of blood, it was a =
face that=20
he knew. She kept on putting her hand up to the gap and screaming. =
Douglas Stone=20
sat down at the foot of the couch with his knife and his forceps. The =
room was=20
whirling round, and he had felt something go like a ripping seam behind =
his ear.=20
A bystander would have said that his face was the more ghastly of the =
two. As in=20
a dream, or as if he had been looking at something at the play, he was =
conscious=20
that the Turk's hair and beard lay upon the table, and that Lord Sannox =
was=20
leaning against the wall with his hand to his side, laughing silently. =
The=20
screams had died away now, and the dreadful head had dropped back again =
upon the=20
pillow, but Douglas Stone still sat motionless, and Lord Sannox still =
chuckled=20
quietly to himself. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It was really very necessary for Marion, =
this=20
operation," said he, "not physically, but morally, you know, morally." =
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Douglas Stone stooped for yards and began to =
play=20
with the fringe of the coverlet. His knife tinkled down upon the ground, =
but he=20
still held the forceps and something more. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I had long intended to make a little =
example," said=20
Lord Sannox, suavely. "Your note of Wednesday miscarried, and I have it =
here in=20
my pocket-book. I took some pains in carrying out my idea. The wound, by =
the=20
way, was from nothing more dangerous than my signet ring." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He glanced keenly at his silent companion, =
and=20
cocked the small revolver which he held in his coat pocket. But Douglas =
Stone=20
was still picking at the coverlet. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You see you have kept your appointment =
after all,"=20
said Lord Sannox. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And at that Douglas Stone began to laugh. He =
laughed=20
long and loudly. But Lord Sannox did not laugh now. Something like fear=20
sharpened and hardened his features. He walked from the room, and he =
walked on=20
tiptoe. The old woman was waiting outside. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Attend to your mistress when she awakes," =
said Lord=20
Sannox. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he went down to the street. The cab was =
at the=20
door, and the driver raised his hand to his hat. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "John," said Lord Sannox, "you will take the =
doctor=20
home first. He will want leading downstairs, I think. Tell his butler =
that he=20
has been taken ill at a case." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, sir." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you can take Lady Sannox home." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And how about yourself, sir?" </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, my address for the next few months will =
be=20
Hotel di Roma, Venice. Just see that the letters are sent on. And tell =
Stevens=20
to exhibit all the purple chrysanthemums next Monday, and to wire me the =

result." </P></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
