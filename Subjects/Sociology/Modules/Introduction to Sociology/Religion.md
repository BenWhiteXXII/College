# Religion as an Agency of Socialisation

*Secularisation* is a term used to argue Religion has less importance in society and its [norms and values](Norms and Values).
Christianity still plays a major role in [the UK's curriculum](Education) as, though physical attendance to churches and other places of worship may not be as high as previous generations, [the faithâ€™s influence is still high](./Class Files/religion-graph.png).
