# Agencies of Socialisation
Socialisation can be performed by different 'agencies', such as:

* [Family](Family)
* [Religion](Religion)
* [Education](Education) (School / University)
* [The Media](Media)
* Work
* Prison

and while each of these teach different [norms and values](Norms and Values), the family is argued to be the most important agency.
