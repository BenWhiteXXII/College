# Moral Panics
Stanley Cohen defined moral panics as:
'*Societal overreaction to a certain group or type of behaviour that is taken as symptomatic of general social disorder*'.

Moral panics are usually driven or inspired by [the media](Media), which have the most outreach for spreading [ideology](Norms and Values).

## The process of a moral panic
1. The Media identify a group as a *Folk Devil* - a threat to the Societies values
2. The Media present the group in a negative and stereotypical way thereby exaggerating the scale of the problem.
3. 'Moral entrpreneurs', politicians, police chiefs and other respectable people condemn the group and its behaviour.
