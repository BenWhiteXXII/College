## The Family as an Agency of Socialisation
The family is part of [primary socialisation](Socialisation). We learn our [norms and values](Norms and Values) in the family through 'Role Modelling' - *'When an individual observes another personâ€™s behaviour & modifies their own behaviour to replicate theirs'.*
This means that our understanding of gender and sexuality is at first shaped by the family.
