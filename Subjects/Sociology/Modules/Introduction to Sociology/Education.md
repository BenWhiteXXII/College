# Education as an Agency of Socialisation
Education is part of [secondary socialisation](Socialisation). To understand the full extent of what is taught through schools we must split education into the Formal and Hidden Curriculum.

* Formal Curriculum - includes: subject knowledge, employment skills, skills for independent life.

* Hidden Curriculum - this includes everything outside of formal lesson plans (not taught through conscious intent), such as: ettiquette, being on time, working hard.

## Positive view of Education as Socialisation
Known as the Functionalist view of Education, Talcott Parsons in 1959 outlined his view on how Education relates to Society and its [values](Norms and Values).
