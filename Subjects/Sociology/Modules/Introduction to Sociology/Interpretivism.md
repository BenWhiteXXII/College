# Interpretivism
A view that stresses the focus on the personal, micro-level rather than the macro.
To interpretivists, society does not exist outside of (or prior to) the interaction between individuals.
We ourselves choose what to do and have control over the way we act.
In this way data is collected in an open-ended fashion and leads to qualitative research methods.
