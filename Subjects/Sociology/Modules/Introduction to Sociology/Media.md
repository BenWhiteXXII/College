# The Mass Media as an Agency of Socialisation
Mass Media includes:
* Printed Media (newspapers/ magazines)
* TV
* Internet
* Social Meida
* VOD
* Books
* Billboards
* Graffiti

and there are many debates on how powerful the media is at incluencing people; from being blamed for mass shootings to being praised for providing good role models to emerge.

## Criticisms of the Media
The representations of different people, ethnicities and genders in the media have been questioned.

Feminists argue that women are both under and misrepresented more than men as well as being taught that their roles in society are less important.
This is otherwise known as *Symbolic Annihilation*.

The representation and portrayal of different ethnicities has also been questioned, mainly through how it treats the victims of [moral panics](Moral Panics).
