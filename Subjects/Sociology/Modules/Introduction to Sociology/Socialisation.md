# Socialisation
Socialisation is the process by which we learn behaviours and culture (our [Norms and Values](Norms and Values)), and is performed by different [agencies](Agencies of Socialisation)
There are two main kinds of socialisation: Primary Socialisation and Secondary Socialisation.

## Primary Socialisation
This happens when we are young and at this stage we are socialised by our [family](Family).

## Secondary Socialisation
When we grow up, we are exposed to institutions, such as [the media](Media), which continue to socialise us.
