# My Fears for the access course

The first of my fears for the access course is that I've already become too closed minded, that my brain plasticity has broken down into grinding rubber.
I worry that I've thought too long with Althusser and Hegel that I'll be refuted by Parsons in the next lesson, becoming myself a dysfunction to the system of education.
Seeing something from a different angle can be difficult, especially when its a funhouse mirror of the world around you.

Another one of my big fears for the access course is that, ultimately, I'll just make no sense, that what I write will be so self-important that no one will be able to hear me speak because my head will be too far up my own ass.
Will my words be drowned in a maliase of meaining?
The strength of my arguments only the time it takes to decode their content?
Is my only hope to fall back on an ironic detatchment to the subject I've been asked to wirte about?
Can you write sincerly when spouting the arguments of others?

But perhaps my biggest fear for the access course is having my work read.
I've heard it said before that the act of understanding is something so transformitive and deadly that it might kill the author;
 even in English Lit. our arguments about the death of the author do nothing to ease my anxiety.

I'll finish this talk of fears with a hope - that I can be a little less self lamenting in the next essay.
