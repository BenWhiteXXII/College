Personal Statement
Draft 1

But why should anyone study classics?
In most articles and univerity undergradute course pages you find mostly the same opinion expressed; in order to understand where we're going, we must understand where we've been.
However, this, to me, never felt like an adaquate answer.
Most proclaim Ancient Greece to be the birthplace of democracy, an ancient beacon of light to drive us towards true freedom for men, while ignoring that men were the only ones allowed to vote and only those that were not enslaved or immigrants.

But Rome did not fall due to uncontrolled immigration, as some politicians might want us to believe.

I want to study Classics because I'm a masochist.
I want to be able to disect the still beating heart of the subject while leaving the flesh of the beast to rot.
It's not enough to point out to racists that they're misusing centuries old rhetoric.
I want to help in the reconstruction of the discipline with people who have been most affected by its legacy.
Doesn't it feel good to be smart?
Classics is dying in the same way as trying to do CPR on a dead fish.
Intersection of queer studies.

But first we have to figure out where we're going.
