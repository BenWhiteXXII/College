Classics, for me, is a gateway to understanding the roots of our contemporary world.
It is a discipline that allows us to peer back into the depths of human thought, creativity, and culture.
The works of ancient philosophers, writers, and historians have left an indelible mark on our collective intellectual heritage, and I am eager to engage with these texts to gain insights into not only the origins of Western thought but how they themselves reacted to what had come before them.

Throughout my academic journey, I have demonstrated a strong commitment to learning, critical thinking, and interdisciplinary exploration.
