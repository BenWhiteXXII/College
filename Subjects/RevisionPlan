1. Make shorthand notes on the material in class
2. Write up notes in longhand
3. Add notes to VimWiki
4. Create a master sheet detailing how you would explain / teach this lesson to someone else

Remember that shorthand notes on text should only be the essentials
When writing up you don't want to regurgitate what the teacher just said
Remember to encode this information in different ways (typing, writing, speaking, etc.)
