# Short-term memory

### Capacity
The most famous account of the capacity of short-term memory was made by Miller (1956) in his article titled 'The magical number seven, plus or minus two'.
Although he was not the first to declare that short-term memory was limited to six or seven pieces of information (Ebbinghaus (1885)), Miller displayed that through a process known as *chunking* it can be expanded.
