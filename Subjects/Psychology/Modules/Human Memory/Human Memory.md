# Notes on Human Memory

### What is memory?
Memory allows us to draw on our past experiences in order to react to the present and create our future, making it an undeniably important part of our mental facaulties.
Therefore psychologists find it an important feature to explain and deconstruct, creating [different models](./different models) and theories of both the structure of memories themselves and why we even forget things in the first place.

### Models of Memory
The first person to distinguish between [*short-term memory* (STM)](short-term memory) and [*long-term memory* (LTM)](long-term memory) was [William James](William James) in his book *The Principles of Psychology* (1890), reffering to them as Primary and Secondary memory respectively.
It was this disntiction that led to Attkinson and Shiffrin's (1968, 1971) model of memory, known as the [*Multi-Store Model* (MSM)](Multi-Store Model), and the criticisms of which quickly led to other models attempting to correct its limitations, such as Baddeley and Hitch's (1974) [*Working-Memory Model*](Working-Memory Model) and Craik and Lockhart's (1972) [*Levels of Processing Model*](Levels of Processing Model).

Another bonus of competing models of memory was that it facilitated different ideas and theories around memory itself, such as [how we forget information](theories of forgetting).

### Memory as a construct
'Memory' in Psychology is a construct that is split into three distinct processes:
* Encoding - How information is encoded to be stored in different stores of memory (e.g. [STM](short-term memory), [LTM](long-term memory)).
* Storage - How information is held within memory stores once encoded.
* Retrieval - How information is extracted from memory stores.

However, we can not always remember the information that we learn.
This is why we must create the distinction between *availibilty* (whether or not the information has been stored) and *accessibility* (whether or not it can be retrieved). (See [theories of forgetting](theories of forgetting))
